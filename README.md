# Rename and store media files

So you have some new movie or tv show media files that you would like to
rename and store somewhere.

This program will currently rename and store movie and tv files. 
The renamed format is to suit Kodi(XBMC) so that its scrapers can easily
retrieve meta data when adding the files to the library.

## Config File
When run for the first time it will generate a `config.ini` file based from
the example config file `config_example.ini` and then exit.
Please ensure the the `config.ini` is editing to suit your directory
locations.
